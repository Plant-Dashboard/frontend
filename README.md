# Plant Dashboard Front End

The main purpose of this site is for me to monitor my plants environment at home and remotely. This is done by displaying the current and average temperature and humidity, a graph of readings for the day and a live camera stream. The camera stream is only allowed to users that have the password. 

You can check the site out here: https://plant-dashboard.netlify.app/
