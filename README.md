# Plant Dashboard Front End

The main purpose of this site is for me to monitor my plants while I am not home. This is done by displaying the current and average temperture and humidity along with a graph of readings for the day. The camera stream is only allowed to users that have the password. 

You can check the site out here: https://plant-dashboard.netlify.app/
