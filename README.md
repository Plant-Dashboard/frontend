# Plant Dashboard Front End

The main purpose of this site is for me to monitor my plants environment at home and remotely. This is done by displaying the current and average temperature and humidity, a graph of readings for the day and a graph to search and filter through readings. 

You can check the site out here: https://plant-dashboard.netlify.app/
